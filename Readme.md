Prerequisites

Before using the CMH Payload Tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Metasploit Framework
msfvenom
Termux (for Termux installation)

Installation

Termux

Install Termux: If you haven't already, install Termux on your device using the following command:

      pkg install termux

Update and upgrade Termux:

      termux update -a
   termux upgrade

Install required dependencies:

      apt update
   apt install git ruby devicetree-compiler ruby-devicetree

Clone Metasploit Framework:

      git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework.git
   cd metasploit-framework

Install Metasploit gems:

      gem install bundle
   bundle install

Clone the CMH Payload Tool repository:

      git clone https://github.com/sanusi644/cmh-payload-tool.git
   cd cmh-payload-tool

Start Metasploit in Termux:

      ./msfconsole

Navigate to the CMH Payload Tool directory:

      cd /data/data/com.termux.files/home/cmh-payload-tool

Load and run the CMH Payload Tool module:

      load exploits/custom/cmh_obfuscated_payload
   run exploit

Linux

Install Metasploit Framework: Follow the official Metasploit installation guide for your Linux distribution:

Clone the CMH Payload Tool repository:

      git clone https://github.com/sanusi644/cmh-payload-tool.git
   cd cmh-payload-tool

Start the Metasploit console:

      msfconsole

Navigate to the CMH Payload Tool directory:

      cd /path/to/cmh-payload-tool

Load and run the CMH Payload Tool module:

      load exploits/custom/cmh_obfuscated_payload
   run exploit

Usage

Basic Payload Generation

To generate a basic Meterpreter payload using the CMH Payload Tool, follow these steps:

Start the Metasploit console and load the CMH Payload Tool module.

Run the exploit using the run exploit command.

Follow the prompts to enter the necessary details, such as target platform, architecture, encoding options, and local IP address and port.

Once the payload generation process is complete, you will receive the generated payload file.

Additional Payload Examples

APK Payload with Custom Icons and Packaged APK Tools

Demonstrate how to create an APK payload with custom icons and bundled APK tools like APK Override, Metamonkey, or App Chineer.

Generate an APK payload using the CMH Payload Tool.

Create a custom APK icon and place it in the APK's resources folder.

Use APK Override, Metamonkey, or App Chineer to package the APK with additional tools or malicious functionality.

Rename the APK payload file to give it a more innocent-sounding name.

Deploy the malicious APK payload to target devices.

Image Payload with Hidden Stager

Showcase how to create an image payload with a hidden Meterpreter stager that automatically switches to a Bind Meterpreter payload when triggered.

Generate an image payload using the CMH Payload Tool.

Modify the image file to include a hidden Meterpreter stager that triggers on user interaction.

Encrypt or obfuscate the image payload to evade detection.

Deploy the image payload to target systems.

Video Payload with Metasploit-style Encoder

Explain how to generate a video payload using an encoder that hides the Meterpreter stager within the video file's metadata or uses a video format that supports embedded payloads.

Generate a video payload using the CMH Payload Tool.

Modify the video file to include a hidden Meterpreter stager that triggers on playback.

Encrypt or obfuscate the video payload to evade detection.

Deploy the video payload to target systems.

Custom Payload Generation Script

If you have created a custom script or a way to automate payload generation, include it in this section. This can help users quickly create payloads without manually running the Metasploit module each time.

Describe the custom script and its purpose in automating payload generation.

Provide instructions on how to use the script, including any necessary inputs or command-line arguments.

Explain any additional features or customization options available in the script.

Include an example of using the script to generate a payload.

Advanced Techniques

Obfuscation and Encryption Options

Discuss the various encoding options available in msfvenom and how to use them to maximize payload obfuscation and evade detection.

Explain the different encoding options available in msfvenom, such as single IrelandJames and all standard.

Provide examples of using different encoding options to generate obfuscated payloads.

Discuss the pros and cons of each encoding option and when to use them based on target system and security measures.

Payload Customization

Offer guidance on customizing payloads with specific functionality, like setting custom NetBIOS names, disabling SMB signing, or hiding Meterpreter stagers within file metadata.

Explain how to set custom NetBIOS names for Meterpreter payloads.

Demonstrate how to disable SMB signing in Meterpreter payloads.

Showcase how to hide Meterpreter stagers within file metadata, such as PDFs or images.

Provide examples of customizing payloads with additional features or functionality.

Payload Delivery Methods

Offer insights into various payload delivery methods, like using social engineering, exploits, or post-exploitation techniques to deploy the generated payloads on target systems.

Discuss the importance of social engineering in deploying payloads.

Provide examples of using exploits like an email with a malicious attachment or a website with an embedded payload.

Explain how to use post-exploitation techniques to deploy payloads on compromised systems.

Offer guidance on choosing the appropriate payload delivery method based on the target system and security measures.
